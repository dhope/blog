Counts of shorebirds at migratory stopovers are commonly used to develop indicators of population status. Migration involves the potential to experience unfamiliar habitats or conditions. If the ability to respond changing conditions based on an individual's state is selected for, migration counts are prone to shift as conditions change. My thesis examines the role of the behaviour of migrants in shaping the abundance of migrating sandpipers at stopover sites. 

I developed a model to explore the optimal decision for western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) moving through a landscape of varying site type on southward migration. I compared the model to observed counts of western sandpiper abundance from five years of citizen-scientist conducted surveys across the Salish Sea region. The confrontation with counts suggests Western sandpiper distributions between small and large sites are shaped annually by the annual variation in  timing of arrival by their primary predator the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). While the distributions could also be explained by annual variation in food availability or predator abundance I lacked independent data to assess these scenarios. 

I also examined if counts of abundances on migration could tell us about the behaviour of the migrants. Semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) have shifted their stopover site usage toward safer sites and increased their aggregation as peregrine falcon populations have recovered and breeding pairs were introduced to the sandpipers stopover landscape. Western Sandpipers and Dunlins (Calidris alpina) adjusted their timing of migration across a flyway on northward migration. Western sandpipers appear to be moving through southern stopover sites earlier and arriving earlier at northern sites to wait for favorable conditions prior to departing onward to the breeding grounds. Dunlins may be shifting their non-breeding distributions northward, potentially toward larger safer sites. 

Overall, counts of migrating sandpipers at stopover sites are shaped by the conditions they migrate through and therefore the potential for misinterpreting changes in behaviour as population changes exists. Nonetheless, using novel approaches, I was able to examine migratory counts to detect changes in migratory behaviour in response to predator populations and changing migratory conditions.
