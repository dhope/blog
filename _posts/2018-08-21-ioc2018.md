> I'll be fighting my introversion this week

I'm off to the [International Ornithological Congress](http://www.iocongress2018.com) this week just down the road. It will probably be my last conference as a grad student. I probably should be putting effort into finding a postdoc or job and I'm hopeful something will come up, but I really find the schmoozing aspect of such encounters difficult. It is a sign of my privilege that I haven't had to do anything like that in the past. Finding a job with a PhD is a daunting task, but I'm hoping talking to those who have passed on before me will make the path easier. 

Anyway, I'm presenting a poster at the conference on Wednesday, but you can have a sneak peak by downloading it from the website here: [http://i.sfu.ca/RNRdFn](http://i.sfu.ca/RNRdFn) or scan the code below.
