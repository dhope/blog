> How to prevent building every chapter again when I combine them.

I'm pulling together the chapters of my thesis. They've each been written separately with `knitr` in different folders. I've been struggling to pull them all together into the SFU thesis format as each file has intro and discussion as LaTeX files. I stumbled across the solution. It is not quite working, but this is due to my including appendices and backmatter in each chapter. The solution is the package `import`. By adding `\usepackage{import}` in the preamble I can add the following: 

```latex
import{/path/to/chapter/}{chaptertexfile}
```
instead of 

```r
<<ch2, child="/path/to/chapter/chapterrnwfile.Rnw", include=T, eval=T>>=

@
```
which builds the chapter again in the thesis chapter, which will be fairly time insensitive for a lot of my larger chapters. This way each chapter builds using `knitr` and `bibtex` then imports together into a final thesis document. Sometimes the simplest is the best way.

**Update:** So I finally pulled my thesis together and have decided import is terrible and if I use child documents and set the cache path it won't rebuild every time.

```r
<<ch2, child="/path/to/chapter/chapterrnwfile.Rnw", include=T, eval=T, cache.path='/path/to/chapter/cache/'>>=

@
```

also, with `R3.5` things run much faster though that's another story.
