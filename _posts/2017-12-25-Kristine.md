# Merry Christmas Love

![](./DSC_0688.JPG)

I'm looking forward to spending a week together with the kids just being a cozy family. You have been a super mum this year,
even above your past heroics. I feel like this fall has just rushed by and we haven't even assessed how crazy this past summer
was for you. I really want this next year to be an amazing success on all fronts with your business taking off, me getting out 
of school and Teddy starting school. I hope we can use this time together to get prepared for an exciting year to come. I want 
you to be able to enjoy yourself as much as possible this year so I really want you to take me up on my offer I mentioned before 
and get away for a weekend. Whether it is to Whistler, Harrison Lake or Seattle, we can make it happend and I will give up the time
in work days. It of course will never make up for the sacrifices you've made or the amount of shit you've had to deal with, but
I do hope you'll be able to get away and relax.

I'm really looking forward to this week together and I'm kinda excited about the new year and the challenges we will face together 
as a team and family.

I love you.

Dave
